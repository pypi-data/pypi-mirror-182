# Pycalima

Simple python interface against the Pax CalimaÂ® bathroom fan created and sold by PaxÂ®

This module provides a very simple interface against the various GATT characteristics of the Calima fan, most importantly it handles the authentication so values are actually persisted within the fan.

Uses Bleak

## Installation

Install calima
    $sudo python3 -m pip install calima

## Demo usage

.. code:: python

  from Calima import Calima

  fan = Calima("MA:CC:AD:DR:ES:SS", "012345")
  print(fan.getAlias())

## Find MAC address

    $sudo python3 cmdline.py -l


## Home Assistant integration

Please visit '<https://github.com/timutta/homeassistant-paxcalima>'_.

## Command Line Tool

Pretty useful command line tool which among other things can print all
the characteristics of a fan. It can also search for available fans 
if you don't know the MAC address.

For more on using the tool, just run `calima -h`.

## Debugging

Set this to True in pycalima/Calima.py file if want to see more verbose output.

  self._debug = False

## Documentation

A good readup introductory readup on BLE reverse engineering can be found
`here <https://medium.com/@urish/reverse-engineering-a-bluetooth-lightbulb-56580fcb7546#.9ltnsvdsn>`_.

Some badly structured details about the protocol can be found in the
`Characteristics file <characteristics.md>`_.

There is currently no documentation on the module yet, check the
Calima.py file to see available functions.

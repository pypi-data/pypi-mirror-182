## Cloud Application Framework

Cloud Application Framework is a fleet of well-known software libraries which was been extended by cloud related methods.

SkyANT now contains components inherited from [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [Dask](https://dask.org), [Odoo](https://odoo.com), etc & work with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).


## Value

Making software for a cloud requires two vectors business-logic & cloud integration codding.

SkyANT components already contain cloud integration tools, so it gives developers opportunities to work with business-logic only.

<br/>

Prefer cases when skyant.ui will be an effective is making multiple containerised applications and
    deploying they in a cloud.

### Core

The core of skyant.ui is [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com).
Dash is the beautiful framework for Python, R, Julia builded top of React.js & Plotly.js. 

Thank to the React you can build a live, dynamic, modern web application with no knows about JavaScript. And thanks to Plotly your application can produced jaw-dropping visualisation.


### Nice UI

The class skyant.ui.app.Bootstrapped provides an integrated:

- Bootstrap
- Material icons & Awesome icons
- Google Fonts


### Speed & Security

An application builded with skyant.ui can be run on HTTP/2 web server out of box. This new version
    of protocol is binary & multiplexing so it is faster than the previous version. Additionally
    HTTP/2 always uses HTTPS.

### New technologies

SkyANT is preparing to implement PyScript into Dash applications.
[PyScript](https://pyscript.net) is a technology for running python code in a web browser on
    the client side.

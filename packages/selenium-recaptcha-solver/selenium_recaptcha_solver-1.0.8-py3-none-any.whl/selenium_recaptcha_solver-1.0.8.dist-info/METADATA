    <li>SpeechRecognition python package to transcribe speech</li>
    <li>Pydub for file conversions</li>
</ul>

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install selenium-recaptcha-solver
```

## Usage

```python
from selenium_recaptcha_solver import API
from selenium import webdriver

# Example driver, the API works for any browser
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Create API object and bind it to your webdriver
api_client = API(driver=driver)

# Fetch random web page
driver.get('https://foo.bar.com')

# Get example iframe web element
iframe = driver.find_element(
    by='foo', 
    value='bar',
)

# Solve Captcha using API (Usually used for Captcha challenges or invisible ReCaptchaV2)
api_client.solve_recaptcha_v2(iframe=iframe)

# Or solve a Captcha V2 visible (The one where you have to click a checkbox - If a challenge pops up after the click it's automatically resolved)
api_client.click_recaptcha_v2(iframe=iframe)

# Write the rest of your operations to do after solving the Captcha

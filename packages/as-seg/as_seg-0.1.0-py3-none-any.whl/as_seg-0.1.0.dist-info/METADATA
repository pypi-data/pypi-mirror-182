# as_seg: module for computing and segmenting autosimilarity matrices. #

Hello, and welcome on this repository!

This project aims at computing autosimilarity matrices, and segmenting them, which consists of the task of structural segmentation.

The current version contains the CBM algorithm [1], along with a (low-effort) implementation of Foote's novelty algorithm [2].

This is a first release, and may contain bug. Comments are welcomed!

## Tutorial notebook ##

A tutorial notebook presenting the most important components of this toolbox is available in the folder "Notebooks" (called "Walkthrough").

## Software version ##

This code was developed with Python 3.8.5, and some external libraries detailed in dependencies.txt. They should be installed automatically if this project is downloaded using pip.

## Credits ##

Code was created by Axel Marmoret (<axel.marmoret@irisa.fr>), and strongly supported by Jeremy E. Cohen (<jeremy.cohen@cnrs.fr>).

The technique in itself was also developed by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bimbot (<bimbot@irisa.fr>).

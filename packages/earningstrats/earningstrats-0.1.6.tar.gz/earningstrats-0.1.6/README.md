""" 
Returns tuple of today AMC and tomorrow BMO companies' put option chain and historical earnings price effect
Change days_added to shift day by that much. Customize minimum volume sum and stock price
[0] - OTM Put option Chain
[1] - Historical earnings price effect = Change period to change how far back historical price effect shows
Outputs to today_companies.html, today_options.html, today_price_effect.html
"""
td.check_today(period = "5y", day_shift = 0, min_vol_sum = 3000, min_stock_price = 10)

```
### Earnings

import earningstrats.earnings as ea

"""

"""
opd.get_expected_move(symbol)


"""

opd.get_put_option_chain(symbol, price_ceiling = -1)


# Get current stock price of stock
opd.get_current_stock_price(symbol)

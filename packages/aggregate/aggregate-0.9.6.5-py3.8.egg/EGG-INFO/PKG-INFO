What is it?
-----------

**aggregate** is a Python package providing an expressive language and fast,
accurate computations to make working with aggregate (compound) probability
distributions easy and intuitive. It allows students and practitioners to
use realistic real-world distributions that reflect the underlying
frequency and severity generating processes. It has applications in
insurance, risk management, actuarial science, and related areas.

## Installation instructions for PAScual

PAScual and all its dependencies can be installed simply by running the following in a  terminal of a system where [Python](https://www.python.org/) >=3.7 is installed:

```
pip install PAScual
```

However, **I strongly recommend installing it in some sort of virtual python environment**.

For example, you can use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), but my 
preferred choice is using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io). For this, first 
[install mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and then, 
on a terminal, run: 

```
mamba create -c conda-forge -n PAScual pythonqwt pyqt numpy scipy

mamba activate PAScual

pip install PAScual
```

> **Note**: Using other conda implementations such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is also possible, but I found mamba **a lot** faster. Replace `mamba` by `conda` if you are using Anaconda or miniconda instead of mamba.

> **Note** If you intend to use PAScual **in text mode**, you may want to also install `matplotlib` to produce plots.


## Running PAScual


> **Note**: if you installed PAScual in a virtual environment (as recommended), make sure to activate the environment before continuing (i.e., in your current terminal, run `mamba activate PAScual` or equivalent)


Once installed, just run the following command to get the graphical application:

```
pascual
```

And I recommend to try the tutorial from the User Manual (some example spectra
are provided in the examples dir)

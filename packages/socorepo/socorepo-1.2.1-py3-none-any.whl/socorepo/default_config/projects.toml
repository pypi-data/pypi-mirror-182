# OPTIONAL: This special key references templates, which are defined in "project_templates.toml".

# Each asset is assigned all the asset classifiers from "asset_classifiers.toml" that match its filename.
# The classifiers referenced in this OPTIONAL list are excluded from matching.
# This can be useful in cases like NumPy, where each asset matches so many classifiers that ones
# like "WHL" (.whl file type) just become undesired noise.
excluded_asset_clfs = [ "WHL" ]
# All the classifiers that are assigned to a specific asset in unison are called that asset's type.
# For example, if a specific asset matches the classifiers "Win", "64-bit", and "Py3.7",
# that asset's type would be "Win 64-bit Py3.7".
#
# This OPTIONAL key lists patterns for so-called featured asset types.
# For each featured type, the first asset with that type is displayed more prominently than non-featured assets.
#
# Let's look at the simple rules that govern whether a pattern P matches a given asset type T.
# First of all, each classifier in T must match a classifier in P and vice-versa (THE ORDER IS IRRELEVANT).
#   E.g., P="Sources ZIP" only matches T="Sources ZIP", but not T="Sources TAR.GZ" or T="Sources JavaDoc ZIP".
# If, however, a classifier in P starts is preceded by a "?", it may, but doesn't have to have a counterpart in T.
#   E.g., P="Py3.7 macOS 64-bit ?32-bit" matches T="Py3.7 macOS 64-bit 32-bit" and also T="Py3.7 macOS 64-bit",
#   but not T="Py3.7 macOS 32-bit".
# You can furthermore declare arbitrary many alternatives for classifiers in P using "|".
#   E.g., P="Py3.6|Py3.5 Win 32-bit" matches T="Py3.6 Win 32-bit" and T="Py3.5 Win 32-bit",
#   but not T="Win 32-bit Py3.4"
# Finally, "*" is a wildcard. It is basically equivilant to ".*" in regex.
#   E.g., P="Py* Win 64-bit" matches T="Py3.5 Win 64-bit", T="Py2.7 Win 64-bit", and so on,
#   but not T="Win 64-bit" or T="Win 64-bit ARM".
# Notably, by declaring an isolated "*", you can match any unexpected classifiers.
#   E.g., P="Linux *" matches T="Linux 32-bit", "Py3.2 Linux", and so on, but no "Win 64-bit".
featured_asset_types = [ "Sources TAR.GZ", "Py3.8 macOS 64-bit ?32-bit", "Py3.7|Py3.6 Win 32-bit", "Py* Win 64-bit", "Linux *" ]
# In this example, the "official_pypi" template defines a locator with the ID "pypi".
# However, the "project" property is not defined in the template because it's project-specific.
# Hence, we define that property here.

[cinecred]
label = "Cinecred"
# OPTIONAL: The versions of fetched components will be sent through this list of regex substitutions.
# Each substituion consists of a regex pattern and a replacement.
# You can reference capture groups in the replacement, e.g., "\1" would reference the first capture group.
# In this example, the substitution removes the "release" version suffix that APT and YUM packages carry around.
# Only this way, the versions from the maven repo and the ones from the APT and YUM repos match up, and hence all
# assets of the same Cinecred version will be listed under the same component.

Hello,
Here is the README to how to use the _package "Mathex"
So first we have 3 class:
- Operator
- ProblemRandom = No Function Definied
- DrawPos.Library = Only Shape.Circle(Size, TextColor, TimeToWait, Speed,BackgroundColor)

How use DrawPos.Library.Shape.Circle(Size, TextColor, TimeToWait, Speed,BackgroundColor):
exemple : DrawPos.Library.Shape.Circle(90, "#f56", 0, 0,"#000")

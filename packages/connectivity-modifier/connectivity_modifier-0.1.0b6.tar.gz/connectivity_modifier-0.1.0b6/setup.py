    'long_description': '# cm\n\nConnectivity Modifier (CM) is a generic meta-method for community detection while ensuring a certain connectivity\n(minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect a community) on the output communities (clusters). To be more precise, suppose that you want to ensure that Leiden clusters must not be "easily-cut". For example, ensuring that none of the output clusters have connectivity below\n$\\log_{10}(n)$, $n$ the size of any cluster, you can run CM paired with Leiden, and it will ensure that all output clusters have that minimum size cut. CM supports customizable requirements on the connectivity of the clusters. CM currently supports Leiden (CPM optimization), IKC, and Leiden (modularity optimization) out-of-the-box. After installing the necessary dependencies, users can simply run CM to obtain Leiden clusters with strong guarantees on connectivity.\n\n## Installation\n\nOur software is provided via PyPI and supports at least Python 3.9.\n\n```\npip3 install --pre connectivity-modifier # install prerelease version\n```\n\nNote that you must install [VieCut](https://github.com/VieCut/VieCut) as a dependency explicitly. More specifically, `mincut` the binary must be compiled and the path to `mincut` must be specified in the config file (explained below).\n\nSay that you installed `mincut` as `/foo/bar/mincut`; then you want to create a config file in `~/.config/cm/config.toml` and have something like this:\n\n```toml\n[tools]\nikc_path = "{project_root}/third_party/ikc.py" # {project_root} is a specific path resolving to the source code root\nleiden_path = "" # this config option is currently unused\nviecut_path = "/foo/bar/mincut" # viecut\'s path\n```\n\nAlso feel free to use this alternative [CMakeLists.txt](https://gist.github.com/RuneBlaze/beac8fd9d81458964b693b71926f68c8)\nfile if having issues with compiling VieCut using their built-in CMakeLists (e.g. having issues with MPI, etc.).\n\nIf the main executable detects that `cm.toml` is in the current working directory, the `cm.toml` config file will have the highest priority instead.\n\nAfter all this, try `cm --help`, and you should see something like this:\n\n```bash\nUsage: cm [OPTIONS]\n\n  Connectivity-Modifier (CM). Take a network and cluster it ensuring cut\n  validity\n\nOptions:\n  -i, --input TEXT                [required]\n[...]\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOur main executable is provided as `cm`, and we list the options below:\n\n### `-i, --input GRAPH_TSV`\n\nThe input graph to be clustered, where `graph.tsv` is a tab-delimited edgelist, only including integer edge ids. Note that we follow the `igraph` convention, where we assume that the input node ids are continuous, and if not, dummy nodes are added.\n\n### `-c, --clusterer [leiden|ikc|leiden_mod]`\n\nThe clusterer to be paired with. If using with an existing clustering (`-e`), then the same clusterer must be used (see below). Otherwise, one must decide which clusterer should be used. The clusterers are:\n\n - `leiden`: Leiden (`leidenalg`) with CPM optimization, must specify `-g, --resolution` later\n - `ikc`: Iterative k-core, must specify `-k` later\n - `leiden_mod`: Leiden with modularity optimization, no other parameters allowed to be specified\n\n### `-e, --existing-clustering CLUSTERING_FILE`\n\nSpecifies the starting clustering (in effect saving time for `cm` to reproduce the initial clustering) to be `modified` to have sufficient connectivity thresholds (c.f. `-t`). The file format is "native" to the clustering method. For example, for IKC, it is the default IKC csv output format. For Leiden, it is the Leiden output format (i.e., tab-delimited node_id cluster_id file).\n\n### `-g, --resolution FLOAT`, `-k, --k INTEGER`\n\nThe respective parameters for either Leiden(CPM) (`-c leiden`) or IKC (`-c ikc`). Only at most one should be specified, and for modularity optimization neither should be specified.\n\n### `-o, --output OUTPUT_PREFIX`\n\nThe output prefix. Two files will be produced, first the `OUTPUT_PREFIX` will have a file denoting the last cluster a node has been in, and `{OUTPUT_PREFIX}.tree.json` is a serialized tree denoting the history of the execution of the algorithm. See also [converting the output to more parsable formats](#format-conversion).\n\n### `-t, --threshold TEXT`\n\nThreshold expression. `cm` guarantees that the output clustering all have clusters that are above a specific threshold. We list some examples for `-t` below:\n\n```bash\n# each line denotes a valid example for "-t"\n2 # connectivity must > 2\n0.1mcd # connectivity must > 0.1 MCD, MCD the minimum intra-cluster degree\n0.1mcd+42 # linear combinations are allowed to some extent\n1log10 # > log10 of size of cluster\n99log10+0.0002mcd+1 # combinations like this are allowed\n```\n\n### `-d, --working-dir TEXT`\n\nOptional for throw-away runs; specifies where `cm` should store its temporary files. Prudently one\nshould always specify different working directories for different runs under the same directory.\n\n### `--ignore-trees` & `--ignore-smaller-than INTEGER`\n\nAllows CM to skip processing trees (those clusters with nodes equals number of edges plus one) and\nthose clusters that are smaller than the specified number. These clusters will be skipped for processing\nbut included in the output.\n\n## Example commands\n\n```bash\n# Leiden, CPM optimization (resolution = 0.1)\n# BUT, the output clusters must satisfy global connectivity > 1 * log10(n), n the size of cluster\ncm -i graph.tsv -c leiden -g 0.1 -t 1log10 -o leiden_clus.txt\ncm2universal -g graph.tsv -i leiden_clus.txt -o leiden_clus.txt\n# generates two files: leiden_clus.txt.before.json and leiden_clus.txt.after.json\n# See also "Format Conversion"\n```\n\n```bash\n# IKC, k = 10\n# BUT, the output clusters must satisfy global connectivity > 0.1 * mcd, MCD the minimum intra-cluster degree among all nodes\n# we additionally use an existing IKC clustering (ikc_output.csv) as the starting point to be modified\ncm -i graph.tsv -c ikc -k 10 -t 0.1mcd -e ikc_output.csv -o ikc_clus.txt\n```\n\n**Note** that for serious runs, `-d` should also be specified to avoid overwriting temporary files.\n\n## Format Conversion\n\nThe default output of `cm` contains the entire history of the execution of the algorithm, i.e., not the true usual clustering format. This format allows preservation of much information, but often times for data analysis, only knowing the clustering *before* modifying the connectivity (i.e., as if just running the base method) and *after* modifying the connectivity is enough. These two sets of clusters can be obtained from `cm` using the specialized tool `cm2universal` (which comes included with the project):\n\n```bash\n# INPUT_GRAPH is the same INPUT_GRAPH\n# CM_OUTPUT_PREFIX is the same output prefix of `cm`, i.e., `{CM_OUTPUT_PREFIX}.tree.json` and `CM_OUTPUT_PREFIX` are existing files\n# CLUSTERS_OUTPUT_PREFIX is where you want the converted clusters\ncm2universal -g INPUT_GRAPH -i CM_OUTPUT_PREFIX -o CLUSTERS_OUTPUT_PREFIX\n```\n\nTwo files will be generated: `{CLUSTERS_OUTPUT_PREFIX}.before.json` and `{CLUSTERS_OUTPUT_PREFIX}.after.json`, containing the original and after clusters respectively. The `json` files use the so-called "universal" new-line delimited JSON format, looking like this:\n\n```json\n{"label": "0", "nodes": [0, 3, 7, 9], "connectivity": 1}\n{"label": "46", "nodes": [5765736, 4717164, 14154348, 3144303, 6290035, 3668596, 1571445, 2620022, 4717176], "connectivity": 2}\n```\n\nThese files can be directly parsed (each line is a cluster, `label` the cluster name, `nodes` the node ids of that cluster, `connectivity` the edge connectivity) or can be paired with the data science tool [Belinda](https://github.com/illinois-or-research-analytics/belinda).\n\n## Development\n\nWe use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our progress and follow the Poetry conventions. See below for some example commands:\n\n```bash\npoetry install # install networkit and co\npoetry run pytest # run tests\n```\n\n## Pseudocode\n\nAssuming that we have an existing clustering method $f$ that takes in a graph and outputs a list of clusters, our algorithm roughly does the following:\n\n 1. Obtain clusters $\\{S_i\\}$ from $f$ if not provided in the input.\n 2. Initiate a **stack** $Q$ containing all above clusters (the stack meant that everything is done in a DFS fashion)\n 3. When $Q$ non-empty, take $S_i$ from $Q$. Do the following\n    - Calculate connectivity $\\lambda$ for $S_i$\n      - Done via `mincut -b -s -o [mincut_output_path] [input_graph_path] cactus` (where `mincut` is provided by Viecut)\n    - If $\\lambda > t$ for $S_i$, where $t$ is as specified by the `-t` parameter, then $S_i$ is marked for output, and we never touch $S_i$ again\n    - Otherwise. $S_i$ is split into $S_i^a$ and $S_i^b$ by the minimum cut, and $f(S_i^a)$ and $f(S_i^b)$ are added to $Q$.',

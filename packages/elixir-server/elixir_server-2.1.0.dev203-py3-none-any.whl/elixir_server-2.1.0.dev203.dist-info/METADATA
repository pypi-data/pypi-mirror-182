        ## About the Jupyter Development Team
        
        The Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.
        This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.
        
        The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
        https://github.com/jupyter/.
        
        ## Our Copyright Policy
        
        Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
        institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
        Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
        change to one of the Jupyter repositories.
        
        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
        to indicate the copyright and license terms:
        
            # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.
            # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

# [Elixir Server](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/elixirnote-server)

The [**ElixirNote**](https://github.com/ElixirNote/elixirnote) Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Elixir web applications like Elixir notebook, and Voila.

For more information, read our [documentation here](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/elixirnote-server).

## Installation and Basic usage

To install the latest release locally, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    pip install elixir-server

or install from source:

    git clone git git@github.com:ElixirNote/elixirserver.git
    cd elixirserver
    pip install -e .

ElixirServer currently supports Python>=3.6 on Linux, OSX and Windows.

### Versioning and Branches

If Elixir Server is a dependency of your project/application, it is important that you pin it to a version that works for your application. Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.

When a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the main branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the main branch always reflects the latest un-released version.

To see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage - Running Elixir Server

# fnv1a

I'm always talking shit about Object Oriented Programming. Well to show that I can 
actually write a little OOP (I just choose not to do so most of the time), I 
implimented a 64 bit FNV-1a hashing algorithm, class based, with objects and instances 
and all that crap, into a python module. It's completely useless and ridiculous and 
it makes no sense, but I was really bored.

```pip install fnv1a```

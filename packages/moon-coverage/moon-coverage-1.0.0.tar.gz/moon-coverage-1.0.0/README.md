ESA Moon Coverage Toolbox
=========================

The `moon-coverage` was renamed [`planetary-coverage`](https://docs.planetary-coverage.org) to illustrate that this tool can be used with all SPICE based space missions.

⚠️ This package is no longer supported, please **migrate to `planetary-coverage` as soon as possible** ⚠️

```bash
python -m pip uninstall moon-coverage
python -m pip install planetary-coverage
```

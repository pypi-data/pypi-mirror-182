    """
    About:
    Shapes a body of text to match within 80%+ of the
    given length. 
    Adds line breaks after every nth time the line length in a string
    has been met,
    provided that part of the string is a space.
    Also makes paragraphs that fit roughly within the specified length. 
    The function does not guarantee a paragraph after every nth sentance,
    but will try to approximate as best as possible.
    If the length you want is too small to generate paragraphs, you can set force_space to True, 
    which will force a new line at the end of every period.

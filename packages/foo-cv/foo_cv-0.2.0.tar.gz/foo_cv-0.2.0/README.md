# FOO CV

> Separate content and design for CV

We provide two files:
- Content given as JSON and
- a Jinja2 LaTeX template.

The provided Python script merely connects the two and generates a TeX file that can then be processed using PDFLaTeX.

[`json_resume`](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume) is the main source of inspiration for this.

The picture was created using [Dalle](https://labs.openai.com/) given the description:

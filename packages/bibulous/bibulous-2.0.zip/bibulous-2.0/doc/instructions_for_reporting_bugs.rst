Instructions on how to report a bug
===================================

Where to report a bug
---------------------

Either open an issue in the Bibulous GitHub repository (``https://github.com/nzhagen/bibulous/issues``) or send an email to the project maintainer. Currently this email is ``and.the.light.shattered@gmail.com``.

How to report a bug
-------------------

First, make sure it's a bug. If Bibulous does not behave the way you expect, look in the documentation and mailing list archives for evidence that it should behave the way you expect. If the documentation and archives do not contain enough information to tell you whether the behavior is a bug or is expected behavior, feel free to ask. Also check that you are running the most recent version of Bibulous. It may be that the bug has already been fixed.

Once you've established that it's a bug, the most important thing you can do is come up with a simple description and reproduction recipe. For example, if the bug, as you initially found it, involves a long list of bibliography entries, try to narrow it down to just the problem entry. The simpler it is to reproduce the problem, the more likely a developer will be able to fix it.

When you write up the description of how to make the bug happen, try to be as specific as possible. If it is not too long, the best thing is to send the actual file contents used, so that the developer need only cut-and-paste to get it to work.

In addition to means of reproducing the bug, it sometimes helps to describe the environment in which you reproduced the bug. That means:

* The Python version you are running under.
* The release date of the Bibulous version you are running.

When writing a description of the problem, say how you expected Bibulous to behave, and contrast that with how it actually behaved. While the bug may seem obvious to you, it may not be so obvious to someone else. If you also want to include speculation as to the cause, and even suggest how the code may be modified to fix the bug, that's great.

Thanks! It's a lot of work to file an effective bug report, but a good report can save hours of a developer's time, and make the bug much more likely to get fixed.

User Interface
##############

The goal of the user interface (UI) is to visualize the output data and the fitted response model. A variety of
options are provided for the user, ranging from the selection and restriction of the displayed data over
color-scales and error-bars to specifications for the fit parameters.

Starting of the UI
******************

The UI is started via the terminal with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    profit ui

Then the dash app will be started and can be viewed in the web-browser of your choice at
`http://127.0.0.1:8050/ <http://127.0.0.1:8050/>`_.

General structure
*****************

To visualise the data and to grant a straightforward user experience, the layout is divided into the following three
sections:

* axis / fit options
* graph
* filter options

.. figure:: pics/layout.png
  :align: center

  Layout of the user interface with the three major sections: *axis/fit options* (red), *graph* (green) and *filter options* (blue).

.. _axis-fit-options:
Axis/Fit options
================
In this section of the layout the following three different types of options can be controlled:

* graph-type
* options for the axis (including color and error)
* options for the fit based on the response model

.. figure:: pics/axis_options_color.png
  :align: center
  :width: 250

  Different types of options in the axis/fit options section of the UI: graph-type (red), axis options (green) and fit options (blue).

.. _graph-type:
Graph-type
----------

There are four different graph-types available:

* 1D (scatter & line)
    | input: x
    | output: y
* 2D (scatter & surface)
    | input: x | y
    | output: z
* 2D contour
    | input: x | y
    | output: color
* 3D (scatter & isosurface)
    | input: x | y | z
    | output: color

The four graph-types are shown below with sample data and a sample response model:

The section **axis options** contains all the control options concerning the selection and the display of the data.
Depending on the graph-type different options are available.

.. confval:: x | y | z

  | number of rows depending on graph-type
  :type: dropdown
  :options: all input-variables

.. confval:: output

  :type: dropdown
  :options: all output-variables
  :default: first output-variable

.. confval:: log

  | activation of log-scale for each variable
  :type: checkbox
  :default: deactivated

.. confval:: color

  | configures the marker color of the scatter points
  :type: dropdown & checkbox
  :options: input-variables | output-variables | *OUTPUT*
  :default: *OUTPUT* & activated
  :available: 1D | 2D | 2D contour
  | **3D:** same as :confval:`output`
  | The option *OUTPUT* is always synchronised with the :confval:`output`.

.. _fit options:
Fit options
-----------

The section **fit options** contains the configuration for the fit based on the loaded response model.
Depending on the graph-type this includes the following:

.. confval:: display fit

  :type: checkbox
  :default: deactivated

.. confval:: multi-fit

  | select the dimension (variable) along which the number of fits specified in :confval:`#fits` will be constructed (only relevant if :confval:`#fits` > ``1``)
  :type: dropdown
  :options: input-variables
  :default: last input-variable
  :available: 1D | 2D

.. confval:: #fits

  | number of constructed fits along the dimension (variable) specified in :confval:`multi-fit`
  :type: input
  :default: 1
  :available: 1D | 2D | 3D
  | **Caution:** It is possible that in 3D the top and bottom isosurface may only be partly visible.  As a workaround increase :confval:`#fits` by 2.

.. confval:: Ïƒ-confidence

  | width of the confidence interval
  :type: input
  :default: 2
  :available: 1D | 2D
  | Types of display:
  | **1D:** area around the fit line
  | **2D:** two additional surfaces under and above the fit surface

.. confval:: add noise covariance

  | takes uncertainty of underlying data for the response model into account
  :type: checkbox
  :default: deactivated
  :available: 1D | 2D
  | **Caution:** Not supported for all surrogate models.

.. confval:: fit-color

  | controls the dimension (variable) for the colorscale in 2D
  :type: radiobutton & checkbox
  :options: :confval:`output-variable` | :confval:`multi-fit` | :confval:`marker color`
  :default: output & activated
  :available: 2D
  | **1D:** same as :confval:`multi-fit`
  | **3D:** same as :confval:`output-variable`


.. confval:: fit-opacity

  :type: slider
  :range: [0%, 100%]
  :default: 50%

  | **2D/3D:** opacity of all surfaces

.. confval:: #points

  | number of predictions along the input axis for the fit based on the response model.
  :type: input
  :default: 50


Depending on the graph-type the fit will be a line (1D), a surface (2D) or an isosurface (3D).
The details for the selection of the fit parameters can be found below in the section `response model/fit`_.

.. _graph:
Graph
=====
This section contains the actual graph. Since the graph is generated out of the plotly-library all the plotly
tools are available in the upper right corner. This tools include a png-download, zoom, pan, box and lasso select,
zoom in/out, autoscale, reset axis and various hover/selection tools.

.. figure:: pics/tools.png

  Graph tools provided by plotly.

The different specific properties of the graph-types are described below. In all graph-types the axis
are titled according to the selected variable.

1D
--
The 1D graph offers a range-slider beneath the plot. With the range-slider the displayed range of data can be defined
and moved around along the axis. The alternative to the range-slider is to click&drag in the graph to select a certain
area. By using this method, however the viewed area can only be decreased.

.. figure:: pics/rangeslider.png
  :align: center

  Range-slider on the bottom of the 1D graph.

2D/3D
-----
The 2D and 3D graph can be rotated and tilted by click&drag. The camera position resets as
soon as an option is changed.

2D contour
----------
In the 2D contour plot a fit surface of the 2D graph is shown from above. In addition all points in this area are displayed.
Because all points (even the points with non-axis parameters far off the fit parameters) are displayed it is
recommended to limit the span of the non-axis parameters via the **filter-table**.

.. _filter options:
Filter options
==============
The main function of the **filter options** is to limit the range of the input-variables for the display in the plot
and to determine the parameters for the prediction of the fit based on the response model.

.. figure:: pics/filter_table_n.png
  :align: center
  :width: 500

  The **filter-table** with the control elements (numbers according to list).


The filter options are designed as a table. The controls for the entries are located at the table
head and consists of the following:

1. variable-dropdown: select the input-variable to interact
2. add-filter-button: add selected dropdown-option to table
3. clear-all-button: remove all filters from table
4. scale-factor-slider: select a scaling factor
5. scale-filter-span-button: apply scaling factor to al filter spans

If an variable is added to the filter table a new row appears. The table consists of the following
columns:

* **Parameter:** name of the variable (dimension)
* **log:** checkbox to activate log-scale for the whole row (default: deactivated)
* **Slider:** slider to limit the range
* **Range (min/max):** input-fields for the limit of the range.
* **center/span:** input-fields for the center and the span of the range.
* **filter active:** checkbox to activate/deactivate the filter. (default: activated)
* **#digits:** input-field for the number of digits
* **reset:** button to reset the range to the default values (minimum to maximum).
* ``x``-button to remove filter-row

Changes to the the values in the different columns will automatically trigger a recalculation of the other values.
If the **log**-checkbox is activated the axis is mapped to a log-scale.

In addition the center values determine the value of the parameter used for the prediction of the fit as described
in `response model/fit`_.


Response model/fit
******************

In order to predict the fit the response model needs to be evaluated at different points in the multidimensional parameter space.
Therefore a multidimensional meshgrid is generated. Along the dimensions of the plot (axis-variables) the
meshgrid has the same length as :confval:`#points`.
The points are either linear-spaced or log-spaced based on the activation status of :confval:`log` in the
**axis options**-section beside the according dimension.

In case of a single fit (:confval:`#fits` = ``1``) all non-axis parameters for the response model are constant.
The center of the range of this dimension is used. If the range is limited via the **filter-table** the fit
adjusts accordingly.

In case of a multi-fit (:confval:`#fits` > ``1``) along the :confval:`multi-fit` dimension the minimum and
maximum of the range will be used as limits for the generation of the vector. The number of points
is chosen according to :confval:`#fits`. Restrictions of the limits via the **filter-table** will be taken into
account. Based on the activation-status of the **log**-checkbox in the **filter-table** a ``linspace`` or
``logspace``-vector will be used.

For further details on the generation of the response model itself see the API documentation of the surrogate model.

.. _technical background:
Technical Background
********************

The User Interface (UI) is based on ``plotly/dash`` for Python (see `Homepage <https://dash.plotly.com/>`_).
Dash is a declarative and reactive web-based application. Dash is build on top
of the following components:

* Flask
* React.js
* Plotly.js

The entire UI is running on a ``Flask`` web server. Flask is a WSGI (Web Server Gateway
Interface) web app framework. When starting the ``Dash`` application a local webserver is
started via ``Flask``. It is possible to extend the application via Flask Plugins.

In ``Dash`` one is able to use the entire set of the ``plotly`` library. The frontend is
rendered via ``react.js`` (`react.js on github <https://github.com/facebook/react/>`_). ``react.js`` is a
declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces developed an maintained by Facebook.

When working with ``Dash`` there are a lot of standard components available for the user via the
``dash_html_components`` library (see `dash_core_components on github <https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components>`_) maintained by
the Dash core team. In addition it is possible to write your own component library via the standard open-source
React-to-Dash toolchain.

The second important library especially for structuring the UI is the ``dash_html_component`` library
(see `dash_html_component on github <https://github.com/plotly/dash-html-components>`_). It includes a set of HTML tags which are also
rendered via ``react.js``.

For customization it is possible to use ``CSS`` stylesheets for the entire interface as well as individual
``CSS``-styles for each element.

The graphs itself is based on the above mentioned ``plotly.js`` library
(see `github <https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js>`_). This graphic library maintained by Plotly.

# Yog

An opinionated docker-and-ssh-centric declarative system management tool.

`sudo pip install yog`

Some features:
* Like puppet or ansible but a lot smaller and focused on docker.
* "agentless" in the same sense that ansible is, in that it (ab)uses ssh to do lots of its functionality.
* (ab)uses ssh as a poor-person's Envoy - it prefers to tunnel traffic over ssh even if it could otherwise just hit the port directly.

Command summary:

* `yog`: Applies configurations to hosts. e.g. `yog myhost.mytld` applies the config from `./domains/mytld/myhost.yml`.
* `yog-repo`: Manages a docker repository. `yog-repo push` uses the contents of `./yog-repo.conf` to build an image and push it to the configured registry with the configured name and tag.

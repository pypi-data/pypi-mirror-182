    # correctness of the underlying functions.

    # you were just to calculate: colony count ร dilution รท spot volume.  This 
    # value is actually the mode of the distribution, but the mean (which is 
    # what's being tested here) is slightly greater because the distribution is 
    # asymmetric, with a longer tail on the right.

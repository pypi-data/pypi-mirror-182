## Description

RCBS.py (Reactivity of Chemical and Biochemical Systems) is a Python package that contains several scripts and functions which try to simplify the analysis of MD simulations and, from these, to prepare the system to carry out QM/MM simulations using ChemShell. MD simulations analysis has been built in top of the MDAnalysis python package.

The package is divided into two main modules: *md_analyser* and *qmmm_setup*.

### md_analyser

This module form RCBS.py is useful for performing analysis of MD trajectories in a simple way.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install RCBS.py
```

# Roadmaper - a Roadmap as Code (RaC) Tool

## Purpose
As the repo name implies, this purpose of this python library is used to draw roadmap by using python code. This is the first Roadmap as Code (RaC) library. RaC helps to create and edit roadmap in a more efficient way without having to use any graphical tools that are not always easy to use to create or update a roadmap.

With git repository like GitHub or Bitbucket, roadmaps created using RaC can be version controlled, track changes and can be easily shared with others.

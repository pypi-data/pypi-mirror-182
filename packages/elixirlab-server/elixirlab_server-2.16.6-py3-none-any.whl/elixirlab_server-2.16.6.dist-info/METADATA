## Motivation

ElixirLab Server sits between ElixirLab and Elixir Server, and provides a
set of REST API handlers and utilities that are used by ElixirLab. It is a separate project in order to
accommodate creating JupyterLab-like applications from a more limited scope.

## Install

`pip install elixirlab-server`

## Usage

See the full documentation for [ElixirNote Lab Server Docs](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/elixirnote-lab-server).

## Extending the Application

Subclass the `LabServerApp` and provide additional traits and handlers as appropriate for your application.

## Contribution

Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

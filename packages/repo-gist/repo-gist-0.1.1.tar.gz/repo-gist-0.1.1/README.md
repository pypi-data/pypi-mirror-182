write this program, do it in python, run it on the current directory, the script should print out and save the gist locally. Have it to read all of the files in my current working directory (when running this script), it is already cloned locally, no need for github apis, show me the entire edited script. make sure the output is well formatted, each piece of code should be clearly indicated which path and file it belongs to (as headers, as comments). add a tree dir representation at the end of the gist (in a comment)

    I changed main.py after the first two experiments and the results are now
    saved in two different ways. That's why I needed to ude the two if
    statements. The two if statements are:
    - If num_of_states == len(all_states) means that there is one entry for
            every valid rate for each server
    - Elif num_of_states == (system_capacity + 1) * (buffer_capacity + 1) means
            that there is one entry for all possible combinations of (u,v)
            where some are not valid

    e.g. T=3, N=4, M=2 => state (1,1) does not exist in the first case
            while it is on the second (stupid Mike)

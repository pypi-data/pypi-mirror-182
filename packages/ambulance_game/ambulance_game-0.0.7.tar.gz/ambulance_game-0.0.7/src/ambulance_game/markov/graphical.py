def get_coefficient(D, R, L):
    """Get the coefficient of the term (lambda_2 ^ D) * (lambda_1 ^ R) * (mu ^ L)
    by using only the values of D, R and L. The function finds all valid spanning
    trees by permuting around the number of D's, R's and L's. The function finds
    all permutations where there is no "R" at the end and there is no "R" followed
    by an "L" anywhere. This is done in the following way:
    - Find the total number of permutations
    - Subtract the permutations ending in "R"
    - Subtract the permutations that end in "D" AND have an "RL" somewhere
    - Subtract the permutations that end in "L" AND have an "RL" somewhere
    - Subtract the permutations that end in "RL" AND do not have an "RL" anywhere else

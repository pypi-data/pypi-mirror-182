\section{Abstract}
Emergency departments (EDs) in hospitals are usually under pressure to achieve a 
target amount of time that describes the arrival of patients and the time it takes 
to receive treatment. 
For example in the UK this is often set as 95\% of patients to be treated within 
4 hours. 
There is empirical evidence to suggest that imposing targets in the ED results in 
gaming at the interface of care between the EMS and ED. 
If the ED is busy and a patient is stable in the ambulance, there is little 
incentive for the ED to accept the patient whereby the clock will start ticking 
on the 4 hour target. 
This in turn impacts on the ability of the EMS to respond to emergency calls.

This study explores the impact that this effect may have on an ambulance's 
utilisation and their ability to respond to emergency calls. 
More specifically multiple scenarios are examined where an ambulance service needs 
to distribute patients between neighbouring hospitals. 
The interaction between the hospitals and the ambulance service is defined in a 
game theoretic framework where the ambulance service has to decide how many patients 
to distribute to each hospital in order to minimise the occurrence of this effect. 
The methodology involves the use of a queueing model for each hospital that is used 
to inform the decision process of the ambulance service so as to create a game for 
which the Nash Equilibria can be calculated.

The program will open a temporary file in vscode containing the names of the files in the cwd.

If VS Code is not found in the PATH, the temporary file will be opened in the default text editor, and you'll have to close it manually, then press enter.

The order of the lines matter and correspond one-to-one to the new names of the files.

Duplicates are handled by prepending a number to the end of the file name but this is handled poorly so don't do it.

After renaming to your hearts content, close the file and the renaming shall commence.

Use with caution! There is no undo nor is there testing. You have been warned.

# Python Cloud REST API for OCR
Aspose OCR Cloud Android SDK is a simple OCR technology, which you can use in your application to convert image to text.
[Aspose.OCR Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/ocr/cloud) is a simple SDK used to add text recognition to your app with merely a few lines of code.
In detail, it's a set of SDKs for optical character recognition and document scanning in our Cloud. It supports reading and recognizing text from most commonly used raster image formats. Just pass a specific image to the Aspose.OCR Cloud API, and it will return a response with recognized text.

It is easy to get started with Aspose.OCR Cloud, and there is nothing to install. Create an account at Aspose Cloud and get your application information, then you are ready to use [SDKs](#asposeocr-cloud-sdks)

## Release 22.12
What was changed

This is the major release of Aspose.OCR Cloud which delivers significant new features, enhancements to existing features, performance improvements, and fixes. The list below contains the most important features that are supported in this release:

- Image to speech conversion: 
    - Convert almost any picture or photo with readable characters into a natural human voice that can be played in the background or downloaded.
- Advanced image binarization
    - A specialized neural network for converting images to black and white for better text recognition.
- Automatic skew correction
    - Detect image skew angle and automatically correct the tilt.
- Dewrapping
    - Detect perspective distortions and automatically straighten the image.
- Upscaling
    - Intelligently enhance image resolution without losing the content and quality.


## Features
- Automated skew correction
- Automated and manual document layout detection
- Recognize documents with complex layouts in fully automatic mode or with manual corrections.
- Extract and recognize text from images via OCR
- Supports multiple international languages
- High speed with no hardware resources
- Receipt recognition
- Table image recognition
- Supports PDF Recognition
- Text correction using spell checking algorithms
- Various output formats: Text, Searchable PDF, hOCR, Excel for tables.

## Recognize text of different languages
Aspose.OCR Cloud supports 38 languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Slovene, Slovak, Netherlands, Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Serbian, Croatian, Czech, Swedish, Estonian, Romanian, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Ukrainian, Bengali, Tibetan, Thai, Urdu, Turkish, Korean, Indonesian, Hebrew, Javanese, Greek, Japanese, Persian and a lot of other works too.

## How to use the SDK?

Our API is completely independent of your operating system, database system, or development language. You can use any language and platform that supports HTTP to interact with our API. However, manually writing client code can be difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming. Therefore, we have provided and support [SDKs](#asposeocr-cloud-sdks) in many development languages to make it easier to integrate with us.

## OCR in Python

```python
	
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.model import dsr_mode
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.model.language import Language
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.model.ocr_recognize_image_body import OCRRecognizeImageBody
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.model.ocr_settings_recognize_image import OCRSettingsRecognizeImage
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.paths.v5_recognize_image import post  # noqa: E501
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK import configuration, schemas, api_client
    from AsposeOCRCloudSDK.paths.v5_recognize_image.get import GetRecognizeImage
    
    from .. import ApiTestMixin
    
    
    configuration = configuration.Configuration(host="https://api.aspose.cloud",
                                             token_url='https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token',
                                             app_sid="",
                                             api_key="")

    used_api_client = api_client.ApiClient(configuration=configuration)
    api = post.ApiForpost(api_client=used_api_client)  

    img_path = 'path/to/image'
    with open(img_path, 'rb') as f:
        img = f.read()
    str_img = base64.encodebytes(img).decode('utf-8')
    settings = OCRSettingsRecognizeImage(language=Language.ENGLISH, dsrMode=dsr_mode.DsrMode.NO_DSR_NO_FILTER,
                                         makeBinarization=False, makeSkewCorrect=False)
    body = OCRRecognizeImageBody(image=str_img, settings=settings)
    response = api.post(body, timeout=30)
    response_body = response.response.data.decode()


    d = GetRecognizeImage(used_api_client)
    response_data = d.get_recognize_image({'id': id}).response.data
    response_data = response_data.decode()
    response_data = json.loads(response_data)
    assert response_data['responseStatusCode'] == 'Ok' and response_data['taskStatus'] == 'Completed'
    for data in response_data['results']:
        result = data['data']
        result_dec = base64.b64decode(result).decode()
        print(result_dec)

```

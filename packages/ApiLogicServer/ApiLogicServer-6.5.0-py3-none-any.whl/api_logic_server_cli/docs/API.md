## JSON:API - Related Data, Filtering, Sorting, Pagination, Swagger

The `ApiLogicServer create` command creates an API Logic Project that implements your API.  No additional code is required.

Start the server, and open your Browser.  You can explore your API in the automatically generated swagger shown below.
Here it is, [running at PythonAnyWhere](http://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/api){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

JSON:APIs are interesting because they are _client configurable,_ to __reduce network traffic__ and __minimize organizational dependencies.__

  > **Key Take-away:** instant *rich* APIs, with filtering, sorting, pagination and swagger.  **Custom App Dev is unblocked.**

## Key Usage: custom apps

The automatic Admin App is useful, but most systems will require custom User Interfaces.  Use your favorite framework (eg, React).

  > **Key Take-away:** your API encapsulates your logic, factoring it out of APIs for greater concisenss and sharing / consistency.

  > Tip: use Swagger to debug your API parameters, then use the copy/paste services to use these in your application.

sysinfop
========

Lightweight system info utility

   Sysinfop is my own attempt at a *Neofetch* / *Screenfetch* style cli
   app. Sysinfop Is built using Python3 and requires both a working
   Python3 install as well as the Poetry build tool available on your
   system if you are building the project from source. Pre-built
   ``wheel``, ``sdist``, ``.exe`` (Windows), and ``.app`` (MacOS) assets
   will be available soon...

What does it look like?
-----------------------

On a 2022 Macbook Air for example, it will output the following.

.. code:: shell

     hostname.local
     * IP: 127.0.0.1
     * OS: Darwin
     * CPU: arm
     * RAM: 8 GB

How to use it
-------------

Simply call ``sysinfop`` from your shell configuration.

bash
~~~~

.. code:: shell

   $ echo "sysinfop" >> ~/.bashrc

zsh
~~~

.. code:: shell

   $ echo "sysinfop" >> ~/.zshrc

How to install it
-----------------

Install from pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

   pip install sysinfop

Contributing

The project is a simple Python 3 app that is built using the Poetry
tool, this is all you need to contribute. PR's, issues, etc. all

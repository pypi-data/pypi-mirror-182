## What is it?

Google Workspace backup and restore solution. Currently supported only the gmail messages.

## Why?

[gmvault](https://github.com/gaubert/gmvault) authentication method is not usable in Google Workspace wide, 
and is still abandoned (?).

## Currently implemented functionality

- Google Workspace
  - authentication with p12 service account file (it can be applied to the entire workspace.)
- Gmail
  - full backup
    Download all messages
  - full backup continuously
    Scanning the full mailbox, but download only the new messages.
  - full restore to an empty mailbox
    At the moment, it does not check whether the message already exists, so if the account is not empty, duplicate messages are generated!
  - *partially restore with pre-filtered files at the file system level*

Additional functionality under development.

## Functionality planned in the near future

- Google Workspace
  - list all workspace accounts email addresses
- Gmail
  - Support for standard gmail account authentication
  - Retention of deleted mails
    
    *Purpose: to be easy to use even without additional snapshot storage.*
  - Filtered restore
  - Live restore without duplicate mails.
    
    *Currently not check email exists or not, and restoring forcely.*

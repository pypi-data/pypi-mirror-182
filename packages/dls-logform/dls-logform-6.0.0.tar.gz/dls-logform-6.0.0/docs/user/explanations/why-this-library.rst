Why this library
-----------------------

The Python programmer typically uses the standard Python logging to produce info, debug and exception messages.
The target audiences for these message include end-users, developers and logging servers such as logstash and graylog.

It is not trivial to format messages with the correct information which suits all three consumers.

This library provides the programmer with a minimal-code solution for consistent and readable log formatting.

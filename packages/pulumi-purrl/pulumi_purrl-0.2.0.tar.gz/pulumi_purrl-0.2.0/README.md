# Purrl

![](img/purrl.png)

This provider is designed to be a flexible extension of your Pulumi code to make API calls to your target endpoint. Purrl is useful when a provider does not have a resource or data source that you require, so Purrl can be used to make substitute API calls.

## Provider Binary

The Purrl provider binary is a third party binary. It can be installed using the pulumi plugin command.

```bash
pulumi plugin install resource purrl <version> --server github://api.github.com/dirien
```

Replace the version string with your desired version.

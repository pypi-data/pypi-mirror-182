### Command line tool in python to place & update reservations at CÃ©gep Sainte-Foy gym.

## Installing
```bash
pip install cgs
```

## Usage
```python
import cgs

# login and create a reservation
cgs.login_create()
```
## Command line usage
In order to get started you will need to first set matricule & password and run `--get-uid` to fetch uid (make sure that your matricule & password are correct else you will not be able to get your uid). 
```bash
cgs config --mat your_matricule
cgs config --pwd your_password
cgs config --get-uid
```
verify credentials with: `cgs config --show`

list options with: `cgs --help`

### ex: create reservation at 12 (time is 0-24)
```bash
cgs create -t 12
```
list possible flags with: `cgs create --help`

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Right now the next step is to make a function that automatically fetches the userID, since most people don't know it. It is possible to fetch it only with matricule & password. DM me on twitter [@msa720360](https://twitter.com/msa720360) if you have any questions.

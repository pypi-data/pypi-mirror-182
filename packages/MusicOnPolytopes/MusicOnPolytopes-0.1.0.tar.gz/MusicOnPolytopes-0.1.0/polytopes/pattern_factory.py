# Generating polytopes: ``Patterns''.
We call in this part ``pattern'' the nested/computationnal representation of a polytope.
This work relies mainly on studies operated by Corentin Louboutin [1] and Corentin Guichaoua [2].

The principle of polytopes is to adapt chord sequences to geometrical forms, and infer relations between these elements with geomtrical proximity.
Hence, musical elements won't be (only) linked in chronological order, but may be linked by their inner position in different bars.
``Patterns'' computationnaly represent polytopes. Concretely, they are nested list.
The idea of nesting list comes from the fact that polytopes are n-hypercubes, 
and that a n-hypercube can be seen as the concatenation of 2 (n-1)-hypercubes.
Hence, recursively, we can nest any n-hypercube as a concatenation of some m-hypercbes (m < n, 2**(n-m) to be precise).
TODO: Add own reference when published/arXived, comments won't be enough.

This code below is intended to generate the patterns, which will then be used for intepreting music.
Basically, polytopes are either n-dimensional hypercubes (called ``regular'' polytopes),
or n-dimensions hypercubes where m-dimensional hypercubes have been deleted and/or added (m < n).
More details can be found in [2].
The idea is then to generate a n-dimensional hypercube, and then to alter it.
This is made by encoding the positions which need to be altered, either by addition or deletion.
In this file, they're called addition or deletion "codes", and are lists of booleans (0 or 1).
Concretely, all codes are binary numbers, and are constructed to indicate where and how many positions need to be altered.
Even though each element in the polytope can be specified by dichotomy (by construction, by concatenating two polytopes when increasing the dimension, see pattern_manip.py),
**the goal of codes here is not to indicate individually each position which need to be altered**. 

- Codes are related to the notion of dimensions in the nesting:
     - The first element of the code (left element, the first in the list) will encode information about the 2 polytopes of dimension n-1
     - The second element of the code will encode information about polytopes at the n-2 dimension
     - The third element of the code will encode information about polytopes at the n-3 dimension
     - And so on until the last one, which represent information at the last nesting dimension (so directly on elements)
     
- As a dichotomy principle, the alteration will be propagated with binary rules at each dimension:
     - If the current boolean is a 1, this alteration will affect both nested polytopes.
     - If the current boolean is a 0, this alteration will only affect the second nested polytope, the one "on the right" (geometrically).

- In that sense, at every dimension, if the current boolean is 0, the code will only be propagated to the 2nd nested polytope, and the 1st nested polytope will be left without alteration.
Otherwise, if it's a 1, the rest of the code will be copied to both polytopes of lower dimension.

- At the last level, a 0 will indicate to alter only the 2nd polytope (so the element on the right), and a 1 will indicate to alter both.
Hence, a code composed of zeroes ([0,0,...,0]) will still alter the last element! To specify "no alteration at all", code must be an empty list.

In that sense, by dichotomy, we specify, for each dimension, to which part of the nesting alteration should be propagated (both or only the second part).
As it is a dichotomy principle, codes have to be of the same length than the dimension of the polytope.

In addition, the number of "1" in the code define the dimension of the alteration polytope.

To this instant, I don't have reference with figures to illustrate this principle (apart from the Tutorial Notebook, on the associated folder),
but the construction of irregular polytopes can be better understood by looking at function 'recursive_irregular_construction()'
    
Patterns are present under two forms : 
    - patterns of ``1''s : each element in the pattern will be a one, in order to represent only the general form of this pattern.
    - indexed pattern : a pattern where each element is represented by the index of this element.
TODO: find better names for these objects.

    """
    Generate codes for irregular polytopes/patterns.
    
    Generating irregular patterns is made by indexing positions which need to be altered.
    This is the sense of this function, which will generate all possible codes given a polytope dimension and a maximal deformation dimension.
    Concretely, all codes are binary numbers, and are constructed to indicate where and how many positions need to be altered.
    Even though each element in the polytope can be specified by dichotomy (by construction, by concatenating two polytopes when increasing the dimension, see pattern_manip.py),

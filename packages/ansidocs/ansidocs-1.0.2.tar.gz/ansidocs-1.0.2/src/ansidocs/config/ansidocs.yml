# The structure below documents the attribute required and optional for a project layout, should you choose to customize or create one.
#
# project_layouts:
#   my_layout:      # required, this is the name of your project layout. The name can be used to link custom readme templates to this layout
#     meta:         # required, this is a dictionary describing the projects meta attributes
#       file: >-
#          str, required, the meta file is the project relative path to a file containing meta attributes. This attribute is also used to link
#          your project to the layout, so the value should be unique amongst the layouts
#       name_attr: >-
#          str, optional, If your meta file has a non-standard (name) attribute to describe the project's name, you can specify that here
#       nested_key: >-
#          str, optional, If your meta file has its attributes nested under a certain key, you can specify that here. An example would be
#          the ansible collection galaxy.yml, where attributes are nested under galaxy_info
#     docs: >-
#       str, optional, If your project has a documentation directory, you can specify the path to that here. Documentation directories can provide
#       custom documentation for this program to use, or just have extra docs. See this projects README for file names this project will try to use
#     part_namespace: >-
#       str, optional, If your project has nested projects inside of it (i.e. collections contain roles) you can specify what namespace from the parent
#       the nested projects will use. The program supports any attributes inside the parent meta file. Omit this to use the namespace in the child meta
#     part_paths:   # optional, a dictionary of parts to their respective relative paths
#       roles: optional, str, relative path to a directory that contains roles. Omit if this project doesnt contain this part
#       playbooks: optional, str, relative path to a directory that contains playbooks. Omit if this project doesnt contain this part
#       plugins: optional, str, relative path to a directory that contains plugins. Omit if this project doesnt contain this part
#       defaults: optional, str, relative path to a directory that contains defaults. Omit if this project doesnt contain this part

### Support Information

#### Records

All octoDNS record types are supported.

#### Root NS Records

PowerDnsProvider supports full root NS record management.

#### Dynamic

PowerDnsProvider does not support dynamic records.

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.

There is a [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file included in the repo that will set up a PowerDNS server with the API enabled for use in development. The api-key for it is `its@secret`.

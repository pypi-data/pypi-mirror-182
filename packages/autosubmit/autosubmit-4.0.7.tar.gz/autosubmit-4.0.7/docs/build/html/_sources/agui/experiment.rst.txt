   Experiment Information

At the top left you see the ``Autosubmit Searcher`` home link that will take you back to the :ref:`autosubmitGUIMP`, next to it you see the ``Home`` link that serves the same purpose, then you see the ``About`` link that takes you to a page with important information about the application (including the link to this documentation). Then you see the experiment name and ``status``, which is updated every 5 minutes.

At the bottom you see some relevant metadata, including the ``branch`` of the ``model`` that was used in the experiment, the ``HPC name`` targeted by the experiment, the owned, and the last time the experiment folder was modified, which probably coincides with the creation date of the experiment.

On the center you see the :ref:`treeRepresentation`, which is loaded automatically when you open this page.

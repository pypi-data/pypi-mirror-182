## Cloud Application Framework

Cloud Application Framework is a fleet of well-known software libraries which was been extended by cloud related methods.

SkyANT now contains components inherited from [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [Dask](https://dask.org), [Odoo](https://odoo.com), etc & work with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

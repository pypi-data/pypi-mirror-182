Thanks for downloading django-admin-better-tools.

This repo is forked from django-admin-tools(https://github.com/django-admin-tools/django-admin-tools).

This application requires Python 2.7 or later and Django 1.11 or newer.
django-admin-better-tools is fully compatible with Python 3.

Important note to users of django 1.10 or below: starting from  django-admin-better-tools:0.1.0 (django-admin-tools:0.9.0),
django-admin-tools is *NOT* compatible with Django <= 1.10. If you want,
you can still use the  django-admin-tools:0.8.1.

It is recommended that you install the FeedParser module
(http://www.feedparser.org/) if you want to use the feed dashboard module.

To install django-admin-tools, run the following command inside this directory::

    pip install django-admin-better-tools

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``admin_tools`` directory
somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python
path; this is useful if you're working from a Mercurial checkout.

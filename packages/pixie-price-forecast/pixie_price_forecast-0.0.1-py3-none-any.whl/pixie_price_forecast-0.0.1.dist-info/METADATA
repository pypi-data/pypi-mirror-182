# Pixie Price Forecast
This repository's main aim is to get an overview of the price tendency throughout the next few months.

## Install Requirements
To begin with, please install all the python modules required to run the scripts.

```{batch}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running ETL
In order to generate the aggregated dataset you can run the following code:

```{python}
from price_forecast.etl import export_aggregated_data

export_aggregated_data(mode={mode})
```

Where `{mode}` can be either `'demand'` or `'offer'`. The former corresponds to average daily data per province for ads with at least 1 lead. The latter computes data using ads no matter the amount of leads.

## Forecasting Prices
As of today, it is possible to forecast the property price per province using one of the following models:

* Arima
* Random Forest: Using leads, visits and 3-6 months lags as drivers.

You can use the following code to run the forecast.

```{python}
path = [location of input]
provinces = [list of provinces you are interested in]
search_grid = {dictionary with model parameters you want to try in a search grid}
model_name = [either 'arima' or 'random_forest']
date_train_window = [date with the following format '%Y-%m-%d']
run_forecast(model_name=model_name, input_path=path, province_list=provinces, search_grid=search_grid,
             train_from=date_train_window[0], train_to=date_train_window[1])
```

## Results
Results can be found in [this Tableau Dashboard](https://tableau.mpi-internal.com/#/site/sch-es/views/PriceForecast/GeneralView?:iid=1).

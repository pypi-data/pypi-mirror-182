"""**laygo2.object** package implements core object classes for physical 
layout structures and design hierarchies.

The folowing modules compose the object package:

- **laygo2.object.physical** module is defining classes for physical objects that compose actual IC layout.

- **laygo2.object.template** module describes classes for templates that generate various instance objects for target technology and design parameters.

- **laygo2.object.grid** module describes grid classes to abstract placement and routing coordinates. parameterizations.

- **laygo2.object.database** module implements classes for design hierarchy management.

The following figure illustrates a UML diagram of the object package.

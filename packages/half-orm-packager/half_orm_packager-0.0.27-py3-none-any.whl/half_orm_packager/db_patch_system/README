# hop patch system

In a hop package directory, run the command `hop patch -p <patch|minor|major>`
prepares the next (patch|minor|major) patch to be applied to your database.

Assuming the database current release is x.y.z:

- hop patch -p patch will prepare the patch x.y.<z+1>;
- hop patch -p minor will prepare the patch x.<y+1>.z;
- hop patch -p major will prepare the patch <x+1>.y.z.

If X.Y.Z is the prepared patch, the command creates a directory Patches/X/Y/Z
with a CHANGELOG.md file in it. You can edit this file to add any relevant information.

You can add scripts in that directory:

* SQL with .sql extension
* Python with .py extension

hop patch [-f] will apply the patch to the database and update the python package
accordingly. The scripts in Patches/X/Y/Z are applied in alphabetical order.

  We ignored the effect the neighbors of a word have on its meaning and how those relationships affect the overall meaning of a statement.
  Our bag-of-words concept jumbled all the words from each document together into a statistical bag.

  You will also ensure that these neighborhoods of meaning do not spill over into adjacent sentences.
  This process will help focus your word vector training on the relevant words.

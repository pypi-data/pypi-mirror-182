        **python-av is a FORK of PyAV.**
        **conda-forge package currently not available**
        
        python-av is a Pythonic binding for the [FFmpeg][ffmpeg] libraries. We aim to provide all of the power and control of the underlying library, but manage the gritty details as much as possible.
        
        python-av is for direct and precise access to your media via containers, streams, packets, codecs, and frames. It exposes a few transformations of that data, and helps you get your data to/from other packages (e.g. Numpy and Pillow).
        
        This power does come with some responsibility as working with media is horrendously complicated and python-av can't abstract it away or make all the best decisions for you. If the `ffmpeg` command does the job without you bending over backwards, python-av is likely going to be more of a hindrance than a help.
        
        But where you can't work without it, python-av is a critical tool.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Due to the complexity of the dependencies, python-av is not always the easiest Python package to install from source. Since release 8.0.0 binary wheels are provided on [PyPI][pypi] for Linux, Mac and Windows linked against a modern FFmpeg. You can install these wheels by running:
        
        ```bash
        pip install python-av
        ```
        
        If you want to use your existing FFmpeg, the source version of python-av is on [PyPI][pypi] too:
        
        ```bash
        pip install python-av --no-binary av
        ```
        
        Alternative installation methods
        --------------------------------
        
        Another way of installing python-av is via [conda-forge][conda-forge]:
        
        ```bash
        conda install python-av -c conda-forge
        ```
        
        See the [Conda install][conda-install] docs to get started with (mini)Conda.
        
        And if you want to build from the absolute source (for development or testing):
        
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:dot-six/python-av
        cd python-av
        source scripts/activate.sh <FFMPEG-VERSION>
        
        # Either install the testing dependencies:
        pip install --upgrade -r tests/requirements.txt
        # or have it all, including FFmpeg, built/installed for you:
        # For developers, this is recommended:
        ./scripts/build-deps
        
        # If you have problem doing build-deps, read this wiki:
        # http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu
        # NOTE: disable all non-server libraries, it is not needed.
        
        # Build python-av.
        make
        ```

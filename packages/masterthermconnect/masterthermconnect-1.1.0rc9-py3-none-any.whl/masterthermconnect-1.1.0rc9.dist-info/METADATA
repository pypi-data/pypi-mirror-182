## About
This module provides the connection and conversion tools to the API for the Mastertherm Heatpump Products.
The project was mainly built for a Plugin to Home Assistant.

There are two entry points for the Mastertherm Heat Pumps:
    - mastertherm.vip-it.cz - This is the server for pre 2022 heat pumps
    - mastertherm.online - This is the server for 2022 onward

NOTES:
    - materhterm.online is sensitive to too many requests, for this reason by default it defaults to updates every 10 minutes, the App updates every 2 minutes. To help the Info updates every 30 min and data can be set in the options.
    - if multiple requests are sent at the same time (i.e. from home assistant/ the app and web) some will be refused by the servers, its temporary.  The updates have been built to report but ignore these.

## Installation
Latest Release Version: python -m pip install masterthermconnect
Specific Version or Pre-Release: python -m pip install masterthermconnect==1.1.0rc2

## Usage

### Command Line
This is used as a libary but it can also be run directly for debug purposes:

DO NOT RUN THIS TOO FREQUENTLY, the new API may lock you're IP out.  The app and web app refresh every 30 seconds. I don't know how many times in succession would lock you out, probably frequent calls over a period of time such as an hour.

usage: masterthermconnect [-h] [--version] [--api-ver {v1,v2}] [--hide-sensitive] [--user USER] [--password PASSWORD] [--list-devices] [--list-device-data] [--list-device-reg]

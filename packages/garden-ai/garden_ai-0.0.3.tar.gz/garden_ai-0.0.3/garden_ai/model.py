    """Object representation of a Gardenâ„¢.

    Required Attributes
    --------------------
    authors: List[str]
        The main researchers involved in producing the Garden. At least one
        author is required in order to register a DOI. Personal name format
        should be: "Family, Given".

    title: str
        An official name or title for the Garden. This attribute must be set
        in order to register a DOI.


    Recommended Attributes
    --------------------
    description: str
        A brief summary of the Garden and/or its purpose, to aid discovery by
        other Gardeners.


    Optional Attributes
    --------------------
    doi: str
        A garden's doi can be manually set by the user, or generated automatically via the
        DataCite rest api using the required fields.

    language: str
        Recommended values are IETF BCP 47, ISO 639-1 language codes, such as:
        "en", "de", "fr". Defaults to "en".

    subjects: List[str]
        Subjects, keywords, classification codes, or key phrases pertaining to the Garden.

    year: str
        Defaults to current year. This attribute should be formatted 'YYYY'.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a new Garden with a ``GardenClient`` instance::

        gc = GardenClient()
        pea_garden = gc.create_garden(
            authors=["Mendel, Gregor"], title="Experiments on Plant Hybridization"
        )
        pea_garden.year = 1863
        pea_garden.description = '''This Garden houses sophisticated ML pipelines
                                  for Big Pea Data extraction and classification.
                                  It consists of a 2-hectare plot behind the monastery,
                                  and a 30,000-plant dataset.'''

        gc.register(pea_garden)

    Notes
    --------
    Mendel's work was ignored by the scientific community during his lifetime,
    presumably due to the lack of a working DOI.
    To remedy this, if the doi field is unset when registering the
    garden, we could just build one for the user with the datacite api.
    This could also eventually be exposed as a `register_doi()` method.

Learn how to revert with git before trying please.\n\nPosting about progress here:\n\n[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/_JohnPartee?style=social)](https://twitter.com/_JohnPartee)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n`pip install codegpt --upgrade`\n\nAnd set your openapi API key as an environment variable like they recommend:\n[In their docs here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)\n\nWindows users can also use `setx` like:\n\n`$ setx OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`\n\nfrom an admin console.\n\n## Your first (safe) command\n\nOne cool thing is generating documentation. GPT-3 has a token limit of 4000 for completions, so larger files will be chunked up.\n\n```bash\ncodegpt docs <paths>\n```\n\nAnd it'll generate docs, one per file. This is great when you're coming into a codebase you've never seen before.\n\n## Unsafe Commands\n\nEverything else can modify files. Have someone hold your beer and try some of these (after you check it into git):\n\nUsage\nTo try Codegpt, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\ncodegpt do <instructions (quoted)> -f readme.md \n```\n\nIt can do basically anything. Try handing in some files for context and telling it to generate something new - SQL queries, new features, documentation, whatever.\n\nOr use the quick command to do some neat stuff, like:\n\nGenerate docs\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick docs <filenames>\n```\n\nChange variable names to be more readable\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick varnames <filenames>\n```\n\nAdd comments to your code automatically\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick comment <filenames>\n```\n\nCheck for bugs (iffy, but worth a shot)\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick bugs <filenames>\n```\n\nCheck for vulnerabilities (even more iffy, but worth a shot)\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick vulns <filenames>\n```\n\nTry to make code less miserable\n\n```bash\ncodegpt quick ugh <filenames>\n```\n\nKeep in mind that using GPT-3 for code generation is paid, with a cost of 2 cents per 1,000 tokens.\n\nJust like with a Jr Dev, it's best to break up your tasks into smaller pieces to improve the results.\n",

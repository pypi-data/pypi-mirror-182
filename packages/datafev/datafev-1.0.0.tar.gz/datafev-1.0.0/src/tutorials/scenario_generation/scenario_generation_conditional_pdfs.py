    Example script for the usage of conditional pdfs scenario generator.

    In this tutorial, these operations are carried out in this order:
        - The data from Excel input file 'tutorials/scenario_generation/input_generator_conditional_pdfs.xlsx' is read.
        - The data provided by Excel is converted to dictionary datatype with 'utils.excel_to_sceneration_input_conditional_pdfs' function.
        - Electric Vehicle Dataframe, which is an electric vehicle fleet scenario, is generated via 'sceneration.generate_fleet_from_conditional_pdfs' function with converted dictionary inputs
        - The statistical distribution of generated arrival and departure times and SoCs are visualized via 'utils.visualize_statistical_generation' function under '/results'.
        - Generated statistical output dataframe is converted into an input dataframe for simulators, which are explained under 'tutorials/simulations'.

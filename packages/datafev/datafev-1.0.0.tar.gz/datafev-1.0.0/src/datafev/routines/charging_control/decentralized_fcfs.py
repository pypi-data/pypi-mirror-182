def charging_routine(ts, t_delta, system):
    """
    This routine is executed periodically during operation of charger clusters.

    It addresses the scenarios where each cluster has a local power consumption constraint and therefore has to control
    the power distribution to the chargers. The control architecture is decentralized; therefore, each cluster applies
    its own control. The applied control is based on "first-come-first-serve" logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ts : datetime
        Current time.
    t_delta : timedelta
        Control horizon.
    system : data_handling.multi_cluster
        Multi-cluster system object.

    Returns
    -------
    None.

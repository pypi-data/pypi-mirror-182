def idp(schedule, upper_bound, lower_bound, tou_tariff, f_discount, f_markup):
    """
    This is the python implementation of the individual dynamic pricing algorithm introduced in
    Gümrükcü, et al., "Decentralized Energy Management Concept for Urban Charging Hubs with Multiple V2G Aggregators,"
    in IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 2022, doi: 10.1109/TTE.2022.3208627.

    This function compares the commitments with the desired power consumption range of the cluster to:
        - increase the charging price for time steps where the schedule exceeds the upper bound of the desired range,
        - and decrease the charging price for time steps where the schedule is below the lower bound of the desired range.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    schedule : dict of float
        Aggregate schedule of the cluster. Dictionary values are the scheduled 
        aggregate consumption of the cluster (kW) in particular time steps.    
    upper_bound : dict of float
        Upper bound of the desired consumption range. Dictionary values are 
        the upper limits of net consumption (kW) in particular time steps.
    lower_bound : dict of float
        Lower bound of the desired consumption range. Dictionary values are 
        the lower limits of net consumption (kW) in particular time steps.
    tou_tariff : dict of float
        Standard TOU tariff of the cluster operator. Dictionary values denote
        the normal charging price (Eur/kWh) in a particular time step in case
        the scheduled net consumption of the cluster is within desired range.
    f_discount : float
        Discount factor to compensate each kW of deficit consumption (Eur/kW).
    f_markup : float
        Markup factor to compensate each kW of excessive consumption (Eur/kW).

    Returns
    -------
    omega : dict of float
        Dynamic price signal.
        Key: Time step identifier,
        Value: Charging price (Eur/kWh) for a particular time step.

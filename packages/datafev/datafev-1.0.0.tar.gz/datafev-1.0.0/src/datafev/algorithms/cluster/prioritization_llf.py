def leastlaxityfirst(

):
    """
    This is a control algorithm that manages the real-time charging rates of
    the EV chargers in a cluster under given power limits. The control is 
    based on the least-laxity-first rule prioritizing urgent demands.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inisoc : dict of float
        Initial SOCs of EV batteries (0<inisoc[key]<1).
    tarsoc : dict of float
        Target SOCs of EVs (0<inisoc[key]<1).
    bcap : dict of float
        Battery capactiy of EVs (kWs).
    efficiency : dict of float
        Power conversion efficiencies of chargers.
    p_socdep : dict of dict
        SOC dependency of power capability of EV batteries. Dictionary values
        are dictionaries for a single EV in the cluster. In the EV dictionaries
        a key indicates a particular SOC range. An SOC range is defined by 
        lower (SOC_LB) and upper bound of the SOC range(SOC_UB). The power that 
        the EV battery can accept (kW) in a particular SOC range is indicated
        by the value of 'P_UB'. 
    p_chmax : dict of float
        Maximum charge power capabilities of EVs (kW).
    p_re : dict of float
        Power requested by EVs (kW).
    leadtime : dict of int
        How long EVs are expected to stay connected (seconds).
    upperlimit : dict of float
        Upper limit of cluster power consumption (kW).

    Returns
    -------
    p_charge : dict of float
        Dictionary containing the charge power (kW) to each EV connected
        in the cluster.

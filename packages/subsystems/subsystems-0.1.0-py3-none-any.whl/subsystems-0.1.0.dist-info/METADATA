# Subsystems

Subsystems is a high-level interface for (web) applications
and it has the official interface for Rocketry.

under the same syntax making it easy to develop and deploy
web apps.

Supported application frameworks:

- FastAPI
- Flask
- Rocketry

Supported web server frameworks:

- Uvicorn
- Waitress
- Werkzeug
- Guvicorn (experimential)

## Installation

Pip install:

```console
pip install subsystems
```

## Examples

Create Subsystems configuration file:

```console
python -m subsystems init rocketry
```

Create a scheduler to ``scheduler.py``:

```python
from rocketry import Rocketry

app = Rocketry()

@app.task()
def do_things():
    ...
```

Start the system

```console
python -m subsystems launch --scheduler scheduler:app
```

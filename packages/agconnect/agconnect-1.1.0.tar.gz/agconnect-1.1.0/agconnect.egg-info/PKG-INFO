Description: # Huawei AppGallery Connect Python Server SDK for Auth
        
        ## Overview
        
        Most apps need to identify and authenticate users to tailor the app experience for individual users. However, building
        such a system from scratch is a difficult process. Auth Service can quickly build a secure and reliable user
        authentication system for your app. You only need to access Auth Service capabilities in your app without caring about
        the facilities and implementation on the cloud.

        .

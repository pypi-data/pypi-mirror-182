    Very fast inserts at the risk of possible data corruption in case of a
    crash.
    We don't really care, because we assume the databased is
    populated in one go from empty, and if it gets corrupted
    the process can be repeated.
    This increases speed in ORCID works population by 50:
    from 845291 / 2 records in 16980 s (40 ms / record) to
    3225659 / 2 records in 1292 s (800 Î¼s / record).
    It also reduces the time required to run the Crossref tests from 994 ms
    to 372 ms.
    See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58547438/20520 for measurements behind this
    approach.

# Figular

Figular generates visualisations from flexible, reusable parts. It is in early
development so use with caution.

The official repository is [https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular).

## Install

The following instructions install Figular as a command line tool. If you
would like to deploy it as a website (like [Figular.com](https://figular.com/))
see our [self-hosting](/docs/SelfHosting.md) doc instead.

Prerequisites:

* Linux
* Python 3
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/). This may be in your
  distribution's repositories already as `asymptote`. If not see Asymptote's
  [Installation](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/doc/Installation.html) docs.
* [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/). This may be in your distribution's
  [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) package already so try installing
  `texlive`. If not then it's often installed explicitly as `texlive-xetex`.
* [dvisvgm](https://dvisvgm.de/). A dependency of asymptote required for
  producing SVG graphics. This may be in your distribution's repositories under
  `dvisvgm`, `texlive-dvisvgm` or `texlive-extra-utils`. If not see dvisvgm's
  [Downloads](https://dvisvgm.de/Downloads/) page.

Install the latest version via pip:

```bash
pip install figular
```

This will install the cmdline tool `fig`. For usage see below.

## Background

Producing visualisations and documents can result in a lot of effort that is
hard to reuse. Work such as drawing a diagram by hand, arranging items, placing
text, aligning graphs and choosing colours may have to be repeated if a document
needs to be updated or expanded to depict new data.

If we can automate that work and have our visualisations react to new data
intelligently we can get a much higher level of reuse. If we can build a
community we can share our efforts with others and build on their
work in turn.

Figular is designed to help in particular situations where:

* You need to produce a good looking visualisation, image, document
* You need to produce it more than once, for example a report or dashboard, a
  set of labels, marketing campaign graphics.
* The visualisation may need to adapt in future to changes in the data driving
  it, design changes, layout tweaks etc.
* You want to share/collaborate on the visualisation or leverage the work of
  others.

Figular provides preprepared visualisations that you can populate with your own
data and tweak the style or layout. You can also develop your own and share with
the community. Visualisations can be combined, remixed and adapted.

It's available in the browser and at the cmdline.

## Usage

Figular produces SVG files. Run it from the cmdline:

```bash
fig [flags] FIGURE DATA [style]
```

You can specify FIGUREs by name, for example `concept/circle`. Follow this with
DATA for the figure.

For example to use the `concept/circle` figure and have it draw two circles
containing 'One' and 'Two' use this:

```bash
fig concept/circle $'One\nTwo'
```

This will produce a file `out.svg`. Use the flag `--help` to see more usage
examples.

Full documentation, a list of all figures and their styling is available in the
docs directory of the source repository or your installation i.e.
[/docs/Figular.md](./docs/Figular.md).

## Thanks

Like all free/open source software Figular is made possible by building on the
shoulders of giants. Our thanks to every contributor and maintainer who have
brought the ecosystem to where it is today.

In particular we thank the [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)
project whose graphics language makes it easy to design pictures with code.
